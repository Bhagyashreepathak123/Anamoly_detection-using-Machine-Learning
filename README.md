Anomaly Detection in Credit Card Transactions using Machine Learning

Overview

This project uses machine learning to detect anomalies in credit card transactions, using the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle.

Dataset

- Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection
- Features: Transaction amount, transaction time, merchant category, etc.
- Target variable: Fraudulent transaction (1) or legitimate transaction (0)

Machine Learning Models

- Isolation Forest
- Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
- One-Class SVM
- Autoencoders

Performance Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- AUC-ROC

Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the notebook: jupyter notebook anomaly_detection.ipynb
